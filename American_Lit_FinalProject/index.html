        <p>At the start of the novel, Bechdel describes her relationship with her father as being analogous to the myth of Icarus. </p>

        <p>The myth of Icarus tells the story of Daedalus, an extremely accomplished craftsman and his son. Icarus plummets to his death because he does not heed his father’s warnings and flies too close to the sun.</p>

        <p>Looking back at the first few pages, Even in this rare moment of father-daughter activity, Bruce still obsessed over small details of the house. Her father’s eyes are on the rug and his face is expressionless. </p>

        <p>Bechdel uses visual imagery (facial expression) and dialogue to reveal her father’s terse and taciturn, but also authoritarian nature. Bechdel herself is framed as seeking her father’s affection and attention. </p>

  <div class="pimg31">
    <div class="ptext">

    <div class="ptext">
      <span class="border">
        <p>On pages 220-221, Bechdel divides the page into uniform square panels of the same size. This subconsciously forces the reader to read the dialogue at a slower pace. </p>

        <p>It is also important to note the abundance of the color black in these two pages, as Bechdel’s panels are largely blue and white. Black is associated with power, mystery, seriousness, and authority.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="pimg37">
    <div class="ptext">

  </div>

  <div class="pimg42">
    <div class="ptext">
      <span class="border">
        <p>The plot of Ulysses is about Stephen’s search for a father and Bloom’s search for a son– similar to Telemachus’ quest to find Odysseus in The Odyssey. Bloom embarks on this search because he feels a strong urge to establish his identity and heritage through parenthood. Stephen’s search involves finding a father figure who will support and guide Stephen himself to be the ideal father.</p>

        <p>Despite their differences, BOTH STEPHEN AND BLOOM HAVE A NEED FOR EACH OTHER, JUST LIKE BRUCE AND BECHDEL. This goes back to the concept of yin yang, which proposes that opposing forces may actually be interdependent and complementary</p>

  <div class="pimg44">
    <div class="ptext">

        <p>Bruce and Bechdel’s homosexuality is common ground between the two. In their final moments together, Bruce steps outside of the closet and reveals his secret to Bechdel. She bonds with her father over this moment and even adopts a supportive, paternal attitude throughout the entire interaction: they complement/complete each other. </p>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="pimg45">
    <div class="ptext">
      <span class="border">
        <p>Upon further analysis, Bechdel’s combination of artistic choices and literary references give readers a much deeper understanding of the relationship dynamics between herself and her father. Despite being polar opposites, giving them the appearance of a dysfunctional relationship, Bruce and Bechdel personalities are actually complementary and interrelated like the yin yang. </p>
